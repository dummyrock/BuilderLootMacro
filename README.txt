This is a macro for automatically running and farming builder elixir and gold in clash of clans. This has been somewhat heavily tested for me and my few accounts but there will always be slightly things off for different people. This script is using image detection on the screen to find where to click. Even in my personal testing the most troublesome thing is clicking on the builder elixir cart. If you are having trouble with it, wait for the cart to fully get elixir (the cart has a big elixir tank on it) and then you can take a small screenshot of just the purple to and save it as "PurpleCart.png" to fix it from running. I even had issues if the cart is not full where it would click on the top right where the builder gold amount is. If anyone has a better solution to this that would make it work 100% of the time please let me know. 
TO GET THIS TO RUN:
https://play.google.com/googleplaygames
Go to this website and download the launcher
From the launcher create an account and then download clash of clans
When it asks if you want to create a shortcut, do it
Find the location of the shortcut and copy that
Paste that location in the "clashOfClansFileLocation.txt" file, it should be the only thing in there
Run the ahk script

Press Control K to start the script, it will run for a bit then stop so that when your storages are full it doesn't still run
Press Control E to stop the script at any point

I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU GETTING BANNED AS THIS IS AGAINST THE TOS OF CLASH OF CLANS
